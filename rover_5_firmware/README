This Arduino sketch is for the Pi Co-op in the Dawn Robotics Raspberry Pi Rover 5 Robot kit

This code may be modified and used as you like for any purpose. The only slight exception to this is the Encoder library which is made up of the files

Encoder.h
Encoder.cpp
utility_direct_pin_read.h
utility_interrupt_config.h
utility_interrupt_pins.h

The Encoder library was written by Paul Stoffregen of PJRC.COM, this again can be used pretty much without restriction, but the copyright notice and licence in Encoder.h must be included with any copies or modifications.

If you have any problems with the code then please ask a question in the Dawn Robotics support forums at http://forum.dawnrobotics.co.uk
